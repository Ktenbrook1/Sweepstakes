In my Sweepstakes project, I used dependency injection. Dependency Injection is a software design pattern that allows developers to write loosely coupled code and reduces hard code dependency. I used dependency injection in my MarketingFirm class to allow whomever to pick if they wanted to use a stack collection or a Queue collection. This functionality allows the developers to have one collection made automatically, based on userschoice, without having to write more unnecessary code. If I were to add another class that implements the ISweepstakesManager interface, it would be able to easily implement into the existing code without the need to add to much functionality to any other classes.
